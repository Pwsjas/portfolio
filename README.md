# Portfolio
Portfolio is exactly what it sounds like, my personal web-portfolio intended to show off my best web-based projects.
It is available at `https://philipsimpson.ca`, or by running the application here, using the Angular cli's `ng serve` to generate a development server available at `http://localhost:4200/`.
